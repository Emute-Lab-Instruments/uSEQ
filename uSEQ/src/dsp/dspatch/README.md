# DSPatch

The Refreshingly Simple C++ Dataflow Framework

Webite: https://flowbasedprogramming.com

DSPatch, pronounced "dispatch", is a powerful C++ dataflow framework. DSPatch is not limited to any particular domain or data type, from reactive programming to stream processing, DSPatch's generic, object-oriented API allows you to create virtually any graph processing system imaginable.


## Checkout

```
git clone https://github.com/cross-platform/dspatch.git
