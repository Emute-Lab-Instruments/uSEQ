# uSEQ hardware version 0.2

## Features

* Pi Pico microprocessor with Lisp-style livecoding engine
* Inputs
  * Two momentary switches
  * Two toggle switches
  * A rotary encoder + momentary switch
  * Two trigger/gate inputs (approx 0.2v threshold)
* Outputs
  * 6 outputs, configurable as either digital or CV (using PWM), 0-5V
* Serial port expansion for MIDI IO or connection to other uSEQ modules


## PCB configurations

### Digital and PWM Outputs

The 6 outputs can be configured either as digital or continuous (using PWM). The outputs are marked as PWM_OUT 1&2, and D Out 1-4 on the schematic.  Each output has a connection for a capacitor and resistor. For digital outputs use a 1K resistor and no capacitor, for PWM outputs use a 2.2k resistor and 4.7n capacitor.  The firmware will need to be configured to reflect the number of each type of connection (details TBC)

### The Expansion Port

The expansion header has 5 connections:  Pico pins 1 and 2 (Serial TX/RX, or other), 5V, 3.3V, GND.  These can be used to connect to other uSEQ modules, MIDI expansion or other

For MIDI expansion, use a circuit similar to the [Teensy 3.x circuit](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_MIDI.html), and compile the firmware with the appropriate MIDI #defines (see the top of uSEQ.ino)
