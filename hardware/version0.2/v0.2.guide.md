# uSEQ hardware version 0.2

## Features

* Pi Pico microprocessor with Lisp-style livecoding engine
* Inputs
  * Two momentary switches
  * Two toggle switches
  * A rotary encoder + momentary switch
  * Two trigger/gate inputs (approx 0.2v threshold)
* Outputs
  * 6 outputs, configurable as either digital or CV (using PWM), 0-5V
* Serial port expansion for MIDI IO or connection to other uSEQ modules


## PCB configurations

### Digital and PWM Outputs

The 6 outputs can be configured either as digital or continuous (using PWM). The outputs are marked as PWM_OUT 1&2, and D Out 1-4 on the schematic.  Each output has a connection for a capacitor and resistor. For digital outputs use a 1K resistor and no capacitor, for PWM outputs use a 2.2k resistor and 4.7n capacitor.  The firmware will need to be configured to reflect the number of each type of connection (details TBC)

### The Expansion Port

The expansion header has 5 connections:  Pico pins 1 and 2 (Serial TX/RX, or other), 5V, 3.3V, GND.  These can be used to connect to other uSEQ modules, MIDI expansion or other

For MIDI expansion, use a circuit similar to the [Teensy 3.x circuit](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_MIDI.html), and compile the firmware with the appropriate MIDI #defines (see the top of uSEQ.ino)

## Build Notes

The build uses large format surface mount components, which should be fine to solder with a pair of tweezers and a decent soldering iron.

### Mounting the Pico

uSEQ uses solder points on the underside of the Pico for USB commications, so the board needs to be mounted on spacers to give room for these connections. The easiest way to mount the Pico is to put the pin header sockets and pin header plugs all in place with the Pico, and then solder them in place.  This keeps everything straight while you solder.

### Pico USB inputs

Connections need to be made from the test points TP1-3 on the underside of the Pico to the USB input socket.

Solder a 3 pin socket onto J10.  The wires will be connected to a 3 pin header that plugs into this.  This means that the board can be removed if needed.

Three short wires (around 3-4cm) need to be soldered onto the test points.  Ideally use multistrand wire as it's less likely to break off.  Tin the pads on the Pico and the ends of the wires (keep the exposed ends very short as the plastic will probably melt back a bit.

For the pad, solder the wires on a bit like you would a surface mount component.  It's a bit fiddly but will work fine with some patience.

Finally, solder the wires onto a 3-pin header. It can be easy if you mount the Pico and the header in place, and then solder the wires. Tin the header pins, hold the wires in place with some tweezers and press on the soldering iron. 

GND (TP1) connects to the topmost pin, TP2 -> the centre pin and TP3 to the bottom pin.

Once connected, you can remove the Pico and continue to mount the remaining components on the front side.

### Making the USB serial cable

For robustness, uSEQ uses a 3.5mm jack for usb connection.  You need to make a custom cable for this.

You will need a USB cable and a stereo 3.5mm jack plug.  Cut the end off on the non-laptop side, and then solder on the stereo jack as follows:

### Testing

First step before putting the module in your rack is to flash the firmware, which is also a great way to check the module is functioning normally.  The module can be run from USB power using the USB port on the pico.  Connect up the module in this way, and flash the firmware from the Arduino IDE.  When you plug it in, it should appear as a 'UF2 Board' in the ports list.  When the flashing process is complete, you should the LEDs doing a quick animation.  If you press the reset button on the front of the board, you should see this again.

Following this, power up the module from eurorack power, and check it appears in the Arduino IDE.  Try sending some commands through the Arduino serial monitor. e.g.

```
(d1 (sqr beat))
```

will start the D1 LED flashing ... try each of the outputs, analogue and digital.

If you plug an LFO into the digital inputs, you should see the LEDs flashing in time.
